# Investigating the Performance and Reliability, of the Q-Learning Algorithm in Various Unknown 2 Dimensional Grid Environments

This Jupyter notebook can evaluate the performance and reliability of the Q-learning algorithm in various 2-dimensional environments using an OpenAI gymnasium library. The related paper was published at Proceedings of the 11th RSI International Conference on Robotics and Mechatronics (ICRoM 2023), Dec. 19-21, 2023, Tehran, Iran, I have included it in this repository as well as the presentation PowerPoint related to the conference. 
Not only, is Q-learning available in this Jupyter, but I have also implemented a value iteration algorithm from scratch which is accessible. 
This repository is a great opportunity for beginners to play with value iteration, Q-learning, and OpenAI gymnasium.
